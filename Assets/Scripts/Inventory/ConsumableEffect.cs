using UnityEngine;

// Purpose: Should contain the effects of whatever the consumable will do.  Not entirely sure how I will use this yet but I think this will be a solid start.
// Directions: 
// Other notes: 

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Consumables/New Effect")]
public class ConsumableEffect : ScriptableObject
{
    // will need: base value, stat(s) affected, increase or decrease, duration, effect over time
}
